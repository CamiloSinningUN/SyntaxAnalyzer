## Use üöÄ

### requirements üìã

* Linux

### Run üîß

Steps for compiling the program:

yacc -d LAB02_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.y

lex -o LAB02_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.c LAB02_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.lex

gcc -o LAB02_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.out LAB02_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.c y.tab.c

To run the program:

./LAB02_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.out [Input file]

The result of the execution of the program is in the output file "saliday.txt"
